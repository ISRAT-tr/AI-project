# B. ABSTRACT
An automatic answer checker application that
checks and marks written answers similar to a human being.
This software application is built to check subjective answers
in an online examination and allocate marks to the user after
verifying the answer. The system requires you to store the
original answer for the system. This facility is provided to the
admin. The admin may insert questions and respective
subjective answers in the system. These answers are stored as
notepad files. When a user takes the test he is provided with
questions and area to type his answers. Once the user enters
his/her answers the system then compares this answer to
original answer written in database and allocates marks
accordingly. Both the answers need not be exactly same word
to word. The system consists if in build artificial intelligence
sensors that verify answers and allocate marks accordingly as
good as a human being.![Screenshot 2021-04-20 004546](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82162746/115274381-29d3f600-a173-11eb-9fe7-b62faa6b96fd.png)


# C. DATASET
In earlier system both answers need to be same word to
word but in proposed systems answers need not to be same.
The newly proposed system consists of in built artificial
intelligence sensors that verify answers and allocate marks
accordingly as good as a human being

1. User Registration/ Login: User taking the test must
first create an account in the system by registering
themselves and then can login into the account to
take test.
2. Admin Login: Admin would be having a login
account. He can add questions in the system and
their respective answers. The answers are stored as
a base for reference for AI to use while checking
answers.
3. Answer checking: The system checks the answer by
matching the keywords in original and users
answer. The other factors are the number of
sentences or points that user has written.
4. Answer marks allocation: The marking criteria is
decided by the admin and stored in the system for
reference. AI uses these references and allots
respective marks to the user.
5. Question answer addition:Admin can add questions
from the system.

# F. RESULT AND CONCLUSION
1. Third party tool can be used for the grammar
checking and spell checking module for better
accuracy. With proper grammar checker the
algorithm can also support compound and complex
answers.
2. The spell checker module provides limited
relaxation to the students. The available relaxation
rules should vary according to different questions.
There is provision to insert words in the files. New
words can be added for new question-answer sets
accordingly. The files can be upgraded so that the
design can support a wide variety of answers.
